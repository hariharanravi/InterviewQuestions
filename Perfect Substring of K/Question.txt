A string s comprised of digits from 0 to 9 contains a perfect substring if all the elements within a substring occur exactly k times. Calculate the number of perfect substrings in s.

 

 

Example

s = 1102021222

k = 2

The 6 perfect substrings are:

s[0:1] = 11
s[0:5] = 110202
s[1:6] = 102021
s[2:5] = 0202
s[7:8] = 22
s[8:9] = 22
 
Function Description

Complete the function perfectSubstring in the editor below.

 

perfectSubstring has the following parameters:

    str s: a string where the value of each element s[i] is described by the character at position i (where 0 ≤ i < n)

    int k: an integer that denotes the required frequency of the substring

Output

    int:  an integer that represents the number of perfect substrings in the given string

 

Constraints

1 ≤ sizeof(s) ≤ 105
0 ≤ s[i] ≤ 9 (where 0 ≤ i < n)
1 ≤ k ≤ 105
